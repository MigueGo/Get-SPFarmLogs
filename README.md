** Get-SPFarmLogs**

**This script permits to collect multiple kind of logs in a SharePoint farm or for a group of servers. You have an extended farm and you need to collect logs in each one of your 5, 6 or 10 servers. It’s a waste of time to logon one by one to do that!! With this script you can collect Farm’s Logs to a centralized folder.**
